Objective:

1. Move your last code's transformations to Albumentations. Apply ToTensor, HorizontalFlip, Normalize (at min) + More (for additional points)
2. Please make sure that your test_transforms are simple and only using ToTensor and Normalize
3. Implement GradCam function as a module. 
4. Your final code (notebook file) must use imported functions to implement transformations and GradCam functionality
5. Target Accuracy is 87%

Summary:
A ResNet18 model was used and trained for 40 epochs. Albumination functions were imported to implement transformations

* Total params: `11,173,962`
* Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images:  `81%`
