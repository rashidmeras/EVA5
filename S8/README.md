Objective:

1. Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository: https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar and add it to your API/repo.
2. Use the modular data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
3. Target is 85% accuracy. No limit on the number of epochs. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed).


Summary:
A ResNet18 model was re-used from the given repo and trained for 25 epochs

1. Total params: 11,173,962
2. Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: 89%
